# Replace Argument Parser with pico-args

## Overview

This proposal outlines the migration from the current custom-built argument parsing implementation to the `pico-args` library. The change aims to improve code maintainability, error handling, and type safety while preserving all existing functionality.

## Proposal Structure

### Core Documents
- **[`proposal.md`](proposal.md)**: Main proposal explaining the why, what, and impact of the change
- **[`tasks.md`](tasks.md)**: Detailed implementation plan with 5 phases and 45 specific tasks
- **[`design.md`](design.md)**: Architectural decisions, trade-offs, and migration strategy

### Specification Deltas
- **[`specs/argument-parsing-improvement/spec.md`](specs/argument-parsing-improvement/spec.md)**: Requirements for improved argument parsing functionality
- **[`specs/dependency-management/spec.md`](specs/dependency-management/spec.md)**: Requirements for clean dependency integration

## Key Benefits

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Reduced complexity**: ~80 lines of custom parsing logic â†’ ~20 lines of declarative definitions
- **Better error handling**: Consistent, informative error messages from pico-args
- **Type safety**: Compile-time validation of argument types and formats
- **Maintainability**: Easier to extend and modify argument definitions

### Technical Benefits
- **Modular architecture**: Dedicated `src/args.rs` module for better organization
- **Testability**: Isolated argument parsing logic for easier testing
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing command-line patterns preserved
- **Minimal footprint**: Only ~1-2KB binary size increase

### Developer Experience
- **Simpler API**: Declarative argument definitions instead of manual parsing
- **Better error messages**: Clear, consistent error reporting
- **Reduced boilerplate**: Less code to maintain and debug
- **Future extensibility**: Easy to add new arguments with minimal changes

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Implementation (Tasks 1.1-1.10)
1. Add pico-args dependency with appropriate features
2. Create new `src/args.rs` module
3. Implement argument parsing using pico-args API
4. Preserve all existing functionality
5. Update main.rs to use new module
6. Remove old parsing code

### Phase 2: Testing (Tasks 2.1-2.13)
1. Comprehensive compilation and formatting checks
2. Full test suite execution
3. Argument parsing validation for all scenarios
4. Error handling verification
5. End-to-end testing with real files

### Phase 3: Validation (Tasks 3.1-3.9)
1. Backward compatibility verification
2. Performance and size measurement
3. Code quality assessment
4. Documentation updates

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Critical Dependency
- **`refactor-main-structure` task**: This proposal assumes the argument parsing logic has been extracted from `main.rs` into a dedicated module. However, since this task is not yet complete, the migration will include the extraction as part of this change.

### Technical Constraints
- **Binary size impact**: Minimal (~1-2KB increase with `eq-separator` feature)
- **Rust version compatibility**: Must work with MSRV 1.70+
- **No breaking changes**: All existing command-line interfaces must be preserved
- **Performance**: No significant degradation in startup time or memory usage

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- **Dependency addition**: pico-args is stable and widely used
- **Code size impact**: Minimal increase in binary size
- **Backward compatibility**: Well-defined preservation requirements

### Medium Risk Items
- **Error message changes**: May require user adaptation to new error formats
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand pico-args API
- **Testing complexity**: Comprehensive testing required to ensure compatibility

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Thorough testing**: Complete test coverage for all argument scenarios
- **Gradual migration**: Implement in phases with validation checkpoints
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of changes and new API
