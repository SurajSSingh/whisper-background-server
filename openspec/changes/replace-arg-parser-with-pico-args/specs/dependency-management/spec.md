## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Minimal Dependency Addition
The application SHALL add the pico-args dependency with minimal impact on the project's dependency footprint.

#### Scenario: Dependency configuration
- **GIVEN** the pico-args library is being added to the project
- **WHEN** updating Cargo.toml
- **THEN** the pico-args dependency SHALL be added with version "0.5.0"
- **AND** the "eq-separator" feature SHALL be enabled for better option parsing
- **AND** no other unnecessary features SHALL be enabled
- **AND** the total dependency impact SHALL be minimal (~1-2KB binary size increase)

#### Scenario: Feature selection rationale
- **GIVEN** pico-args features are being configured
- **WHEN** selecting which features to enable
- **THEN** only the "eq-separator" feature SHALL be enabled
- **AND** the rationale SHALL be documented in the Cargo.toml comments
- **AND** the feature SHALL provide support for both `--threads 4` and `--threads=4` formats

### Requirement: Clean Dependency Integration
The application SHALL integrate the pico-args dependency cleanly without disrupting existing functionality.

#### Scenario: Build compatibility
- **GIVEN** pico-args is added as a dependency
- **WHEN** building the project
- **THEN** cargo check SHALL succeed without errors
- **AND** cargo build SHALL complete successfully
- **AND** no existing dependencies SHALL be affected or conflicted

#### Scenario: No breaking changes to existing APIs
- **GIVEN** the pico-args dependency is integrated
- **WHEN** examining the public API
- **THEN** all existing public interfaces SHALL remain unchanged
- **AND** the Config struct SHALL continue to have the same fields
- **AND** the parse_arguments() function SHALL maintain the same signature

### Requirement: Performance Considerations
The application SHALL maintain or improve performance characteristics after adding the pico-args dependency.

#### Scenario: Startup time impact
- **GIVEN** the application with pico-args
- **WHEN** measuring startup time
- **THEN** the startup time SHALL not significantly increase
- **AND** any performance impact SHALL be negligible for the use case
- **AND** the parsing SHALL be at least as fast as the custom implementation

#### Scenario: Memory usage impact
- **GIVEN** the application with pico-args
- **WHEN** measuring memory usage
- **THEN** the memory footprint SHALL not significantly increase
- **AND** the argument parsing SHALL use reasonable memory
- **AND** no memory leaks SHALL be introduced

### Requirement: Version Management
The application SHALL use appropriate versioning for the pico-args dependency to ensure stability.

#### Scenario: Version selection
- **GIVEN** selecting pico-args version
- **WHEN** choosing the version number
- **THEN** version "0.5.0" SHALL be used (current stable version)
- **AND** the version SHALL be pinned to avoid breaking changes
- **AND** the version SHALL be compatible with Rust 1.70+ (MSRV)

#### Scenario: Update strategy
- **GIVEN** pico-args releases a new version
- **WHEN** considering an update
- **THEN** minor version updates SHALL be adopted for bug fixes
- **AND** major version updates SHALL be carefully evaluated for breaking changes
- **AND** the update SHALL be tested thoroughly before merging
