## Context

The current argument parsing implementation in [`main.rs`](src/main.rs:146) consists of approximately 80 lines of custom parsing logic that manually processes command-line arguments. This implementation uses manual index-based iteration, complex conditional logic, and extensive error handling. While functional, this approach is difficult to maintain, test, and extend.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- **Improve maintainability**: Replace complex manual parsing with simple declarative definitions
- **Enhance error handling**: Leverage pico-args' built-in validation and informative error messages
- **Reduce code complexity**: Significantly reduce the amount of parsing logic while maintaining functionality
- **Improve testability**: Create a dedicated, easily testable argument parsing module
- **Add type safety**: Use pico-args' strongly-typed option parsing for better compile-time validation
- **Preserve compatibility**: Maintain the same external interface and behavior

### Non-Goals
- **Change command-line interface**: All existing argument formats and behavior must remain identical
- **Add new features**: This migration focuses on replacing the implementation, not adding new capabilities
- **Optimize for performance**: While performance should not degrade, this is not a primary concern
- **Generate help text**: pico-args does not provide automatic help generation, and we won't add it
- **Support complex argument combinations**: Keep the current simple argument structure

## Decisions

### Decision: Use pico-args library
- **Why**: pico-args provides a simple, robust, and well-tested solution for command-line parsing
- **Benefits**: 
  - Declarative argument definitions instead of manual parsing logic
  - Built-in type validation and error handling
  - Minimal binary size impact (~1-2KB)
  - Excellent error messages out of the box
  - Non-UTF-8 argument support
- **Implementation**: Replace the custom `parse_arguments()` function with pico-args-based implementation

### Decision: Create dedicated args module
- **Why**: Separation of concerns and better code organization
- **Implementation**: Create `src/args.rs` module containing all argument parsing logic
- **Benefits**: 
  - Easier testing and maintenance
  - Clear separation of responsibilities
  - Better code organization in the project structure

### Decision: Maintain Config struct interface
- **Why**: Preserve existing API compatibility
- **Implementation**: The `parse_arguments()` function will continue to return `Config` struct
- **Benefits**: 
  - No changes required in calling code
  - Backward compatibility maintained
  - Minimal risk of breaking existing functionality

### Decision: Use pico-args features selectively
- **Why**: Balance flexibility with simplicity
- **Implementation**: Enable `eq-separator` feature for better option parsing
- **Benefits**: 
  - Support for `--threads=4` format in addition to `--threads 4`
  - Better user experience with flexible argument formats
  - Minimal binary size impact

### Decision: Preserve model path validation logic
- **Why**: File validation is a core requirement for the application
- **Implementation**: Keep `validate_model_path()` function but integrate it with pico-args error handling
- **Benefits**: 
  - Maintain existing validation behavior
  - Leverage pico-args error formatting for consistency
  - Preserve important security and functionality checks

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Breaking changes in error messages
- **Mitigation**: Thoroughly test all error cases to ensure messages are at least as informative as before
- **Trade-off**: pico-args may provide different error message formats, but they should be more consistent

### Risk: Increased binary size
- **Mitigation**: pico-args is very lightweight (~1-2KB), and the `eq-separator` feature adds only ~1KB
- **Trade-off**: Minimal size increase for significant maintainability improvements

### Risk: Learning curve for pico-args API
- **Mitigation**: The API is simple and well-documented; provide clear examples in the code
- **Trade-off**: Short-term learning cost for long-term maintainability benefits

### Risk: Dependency management
- **Mitigation**: pico-args is stable, widely used, and has minimal dependencies
- **Trade-off**: Adding a new dependency to the project, but it's a well-established choice

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Implementation
1. Add pico-args dependency to Cargo.toml
2. Create src/args.rs module with new implementation
3. Implement argument parsing using pico-args API
4. Preserve all existing functionality and behavior

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Update main.rs to use the new args module
2. Remove old argument parsing code
3. Update tests to use the new module
4. Remove duplicate test parsing logic

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Comprehensive testing of all argument combinations
2. Error handling validation
3. Performance and size measurement
4. Documentation updates

## Open Questions

### Q: Should we add help text generation?
- **Current stance**: No, pico-args doesn't support it natively, and the current implementation doesn't have help text
- **Future consideration**: Could be added as a separate enhancement if needed

### Q: How to handle argument order flexibility?
- **Current stance**: Leverage pico-args' built-in support for argument order flexibility
- **Implementation**: No special handling needed, pico-args supports this natively

### Q: What about backward compatibility with edge cases?
- **Current stance**: Preserve all existing behavior, including any quirks in the current implementation
- **Implementation**: Thorough testing of all existing argument patterns to ensure compatibility
