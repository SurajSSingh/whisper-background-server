## Why

The current argument parsing implementation in [`main.rs`](src/main.rs:146) uses a custom-built parser that manually processes command-line arguments. This approach has several limitations:

1. **Manual error handling**: The current implementation requires extensive manual validation and error message generation
2. **Complex state management**: The parser maintains manual state with index-based iteration and conditional logic
3. **Limited flexibility**: Adding new arguments requires modifying the parsing logic in multiple places
4. **Testing complexity**: The current implementation has duplicated parsing logic for tests and production
5. **No built-in validation**: Missing validation for argument formats, types, and constraints

The `pico-args` library offers a more robust, maintainable, and well-tested solution that addresses these issues while providing better developer experience and reliability.

## What Changes

### Core Migration
- **Replace custom argument parser** with `pico-args` library for robust command-line parsing
- **Simplify error handling** by leveraging pico-args' built-in validation and error messages
- **Improve code organization** by extracting argument parsing into a dedicated module
- **Enhance maintainability** with declarative argument definitions instead of manual parsing logic

### Structural Improvements
- **Create dedicated argument module** (`src/args.rs`) to encapsulate all argument parsing logic
- **Eliminate code duplication** by removing the mock parsing logic used in tests
- **Add type safety** with pico-args' strongly-typed option parsing
- **Improve validation** with built-in type checking and constraint validation

### Dependency Management
- **Add pico-args dependency** to [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml:7) with appropriate features
- **Remove manual validation code** that's now handled by the library
- **Preserve existing functionality** while improving the implementation

## Impact

### Affected Specs
- **No existing specs require modification** as this is an internal improvement
- **New specs** will be added to define the improved argument parsing behavior

### Affected Code
- **[`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs:1)**: Will be simplified by removing argument parsing code
- **New file**: [`src/args.rs`](src/args.rs:1) will be created with the new argument parsing module
- **[`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml:1)**: Will include the new pico-args dependency
- **Test files**: Will be updated to use the new argument parsing module

### Benefits
- **Reduced code complexity**: ~80 lines of custom parsing logic replaced with ~20 lines of declarative definitions
- **Better error messages**: More informative and consistent error reporting
- **Improved testability**: Easier to test argument parsing with proper separation of concerns
- **Enhanced maintainability**: Adding new arguments becomes a simple configuration task
- **Type safety**: Compile-time validation of argument types and formats

## Dependencies

This proposal assumes that the `refactor-main-structure` task has been completed, which would have extracted the argument parsing functionality from [`main.rs`](src/main.rs:1) into a dedicated module. However, since that task is not yet complete, this migration will:
1. **Extract argument parsing** into a new `src/args.rs` module as part of this change
2. **Replace the implementation** with pico-args while maintaining the same external interface
3. **Preserve all existing functionality** including argument validation and error handling
