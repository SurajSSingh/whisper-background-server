## Context
The current `main.rs` file contains approximately 1054 lines with mixed responsibilities including logging setup, argument parsing, model initialization, and audio processing. This violates the single responsibility principle and makes the code harder to maintain and test.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- **Goals**: 
  - Improve code organization and maintainability
  - Separate concerns into logical modules
  - Preserve all existing functionality and behavior
  - Maintain the same external interface
  - Make the code easier to test and extend
- **Non-Goals**:
  - Change any public APIs or external interfaces
  - Modify logging output format or behavior
  - Alter argument parsing logic or validation
  - Optimize performance (this is purely structural)

## Decisions
- **Decision**: Extract logging functionality into `src/logging.rs`
  - **Why**: Logging is a cross-cutting concern that can be isolated and tested independently
  - **Implementation**: Move `CustomLogger` struct and `configure_logging()` function with all related imports

- **Decision**: Extract environment/argument parsing into `src/environment.rs`
  - **Why**: Argument parsing is a separate concern from the main application logic
  - **Implementation**: Move `parse_arguments()` function and `validate_model_path()` function with all related types

- **Decision**: Keep main function structure unchanged except for module imports
  - **Why**: Minimize risk and ensure backward compatibility
  - **Implementation**: Only add `mod logging;` and `mod environment;` declarations and update function calls

- **Decision**: Maintain error handling behavior
  - **Why**: Preserve existing error messages and handling logic
  - **Implementation**: Move error handling code without changing its behavior

## Risks / Trade-offs
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during refactoring
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing after each change, maintain exact same behavior
- **Risk**: Import complexity with new modules
  - **Mitigation**: Keep imports minimal and well-organized
- **Risk**: Performance impact from additional module calls
  - **Mitigation**: This is purely structural, no performance-critical code is being moved

## Migration Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Create new modules with extracted code
2. **Phase 2**: Update main.rs to use new modules
3. **Phase 3**: Remove old code from main.rs
4. **Phase 4**: Comprehensive testing to ensure no regressions
5. **Phase 5**: Update documentation if needed

## Open Questions
- None - this is a straightforward refactoring with clear requirements
