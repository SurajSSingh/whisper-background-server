## 1. Implementation
- [X] 1.1 Create logging module (src/logging.rs) with CustomLogger and configure_logging function
- [X] 1.2 Create environment module (src/environment.rs) with argument parsing and validation
- [X] 1.3 Update main.rs to use the new modules while maintaining same structure
- [X] 1.4 Ensure all imports and dependencies are properly updated
- [X] 1.5 Verify all functionality remains intact after refactoring

## 2. Testing
- [X] 2.1 Run cargo check to ensure compilation succeeds
- [X] 2.2 Run cargo fmt --check to verify formatting
- [X] 2.3 Run cargo clippy to check for warnings
- [X] 2.4 Run cargo test to ensure all tests pass
- [X] 2.5 Test argument parsing functionality with various inputs
- [X] 2.6 Test logging functionality to ensure proper output

## 3. Validation
- [X] 3.1 Verify that the main function structure remains unchanged
- [X] 3.2 Confirm that no public APIs were modified
- [X] 3.3 Ensure error handling behavior is identical
- [X] 3.4 Validate that logging output format and levels are preserved
- [X] 3.5 Test with real model and audio files to ensure end-to-end functionality
