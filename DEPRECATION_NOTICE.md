# Deprecation Notice: SOT Protocol

## ⚠️ Important: SOT Protocol Deprecation

**Effective Date:** November 1, 2024  
**Target Removal Date:** Q1 2025 (v2.0.0)  
**Current Status:** ⚠️ **Deprecated with warnings**

## Summary

The SOT (Start of Transmission) marker-based protocol is being deprecated in favor of the new JSON interface. While the SOT protocol will continue to work during the transition period, we strongly recommend all users migrate to the JSON interface as soon as possible.

## What This Means

### For Current SOT Users

- **SOT protocol still works** but shows deprecation warnings
- **New features** will only be available through the JSON interface
- **Performance optimizations** are focused on the JSON interface
- **Future versions** will completely remove SOT support

### For New Users

- **JSON interface is the recommended approach**
- **No SOT knowledge required**
- **Full feature set available**
- **Better error handling and validation**

## Migration Timeline

| Phase | Status | Timeline | Details |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Phase 1: Parallel Implementation** | ✅ Complete | Oct 2024 | Both protocols functional |
| **Phase 2: Deprecation & Transition** | ⚠️ **Current** | Nov 2024 - Feb 2025 | SOT deprecated, migration encouraged |
| **Phase 3: SOT Protocol Removal** | 📅 Planned | Q1 2025 | SOT completely removed |

## Key Differences

### SOT Protocol (Legacy - Deprecated)

```bash
# Binary format with SOT marker
echo -ne "audio_data_bytes\0SOT\0" | ./whisper-background-server model.bin
```

**Limitations:**
- ❌ No configuration options
- ❌ Limited error handling
- ❌ No validation
- ❌ Binary format only
- ❌ No metadata support

### JSON Interface (Recommended)

```json
{
  "audio_data": {
    "data": "base64_encoded_audio_string"
  },
  "options": {
    "language": "en",
    "include_timestamps": true,
    "temperature": 0.0
  }
}
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Comprehensive configuration options
- ✅ Structured error handling
- ✅ Built-in validation
- ✅ Support for base64 and binary formats
- ✅ Rich metadata support
- ✅ Better tooling and debugging

## Migration Instructions

### Quick Start

1. **Read the Migration Guide**
   ```bash
   cat MIGRATION.md
   ```

2. **Test JSON Interface**
   ```bash
   # Create a test request
   cat > test.json << EOF
   {
     "audio_data": {
       "data": "$(base64 -i audio.wav)"
     }
   }
   EOF
   
   # Test with JSON interface
   cat test.json | ./whisper-background-server model.bin
   ```

3. **Use Conversion Tools**
   ```bash
   # Convert SOT files to JSON
   python migration_example.py convert -i audio.sot -o audio.json
   
   # Or use the Rust converter
   ./sot_to_json_converter -i audio.sot -o audio.json
   ```

### Step-by-Step Migration

1. **Assess Your Current Usage**
   - Identify all SOT-based clients
   - Document integration points
   - Plan migration timeline

2. **Test JSON Interface**
   - Verify functionality with your use case
   - Test error handling
   - Performance benchmarking

3. **Update Client Code**
   - Replace SOT detection with JSON parsing
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add configuration options

4. **Deploy and Monitor**
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Monitor for issues
   - Provide user support

## Migration Tools

### Provided Scripts

1. **`migration_example.py`** - Python migration utilities
   ```bash
   python migration_example.py --help
   python migration_example.py convert -i audio.sot -o audio.json
   python migration_example.py test --basic
   ```

2. **`sot_to_json_converter.rs`** - Rust conversion utility
   ```bash
   # Build the converter
   rustc sot_to_json_converter.rs -o sot_to_json_converter
   
   # Convert files
   ./sot_to_json_converter -i audio.sot -o audio.json
   ```

3. **`MIGRATION.md`** - Comprehensive migration guide

### Compatibility Layer

For gradual migration, use the compatibility layer:

```rust
// Detect input format automatically
let format = CompatibilityLayer::detect_input_format(data);

// Convert SOT to JSON
let json_request = CompatibilityLayer::convert_sot_to_json_request(sot_data, options);
```

## Benefits of Migrating

## Common Concerns

### "Will my existing code break?"

**Answer:** Not immediately. The SOT protocol will continue to work until v2.0.0, but you'll see deprecation warnings. We recommend migrating before the final removal date.

### "Is the JSON interface as fast as SOT?"

**Answer:** The JSON interface is comparable in performance for most use cases. For very large audio files, binary format can be more efficient than base64.

### "Do I need to rewrite all my clients?"

**Answer:** Yes, but we provide comprehensive migration tools and examples to make the process as smooth as possible. Many clients can be updated with minimal changes.

### "What about my custom integrations?"

**Answer:** The JSON interface is more flexible and extensible, making it easier to integrate with custom workflows. We provide examples for common integration patterns.
